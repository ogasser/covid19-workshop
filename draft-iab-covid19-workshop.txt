1.  Introduction

2.  Topic and Scope

2.1.  Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

   Significant increase in traffic growth rate in March/April

   Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased
   and traffic from home network increased.  Strong increase in video
   conferencing (incl remote schooling)

   Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly
   by adding new capacity (earlier?)

   Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE)

2.1.1.  Overall traffic growth

2.1.2.  Changes in traffic patterns

2.1.2.1.  Example campus network

2.1.2.2.  Example mobile networks

2.1.3.  A deeper look at interconnections

2.1.4.  Last mile congestion

2.2.  Operational Practices and Changes

2.3.  Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future
