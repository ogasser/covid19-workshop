                   draft-iab-covid19-workshop-latest

Abstract

   The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet traffic,
   particularly during the introduction of the initial quarantine and
   work-from-home arrangements.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
   Impacts of the pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.  The meeting was
   held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at
   that time.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
   Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.  The
   meeting was held online given the on-going travel and contact
   restrictions at that time.

   COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic.  These changes
   appeared rather abruptly, in particular during the introduction of
   the initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.  The changes
   relate to traffic volumes, location of traffic, as well as the types
   of traffic and applications used.

Internet-Draft  IAB COVID-19 Network Impacts Workshop 20   December 2020


   A total of 15 position papers were received from 33 authors, listed
   in Section 3.  In addition, several other types of contributions and
   pointers to existing work were provided.  On the workshop conference
   calls were 45 participants, listed in Section 4.

   The workshop was organized over one week hosting three sessions
   covering measuremnets and observations, operational issue, and final
   future consideration and conclusions.  As these three session were
   scheduled Monday, Wednesday, and Friday a positive side effect was
   that the time in between could be used foor mailing list discusion
   and compliation of additional workshop material.

2.  Topics and Scope

   [Add some text from call for papers here?]

2.1.  Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

   The workshop started with a focus on measurements.  A larger portion
   of the submitted papers presented and discussed measurement data and
   these submissions provided a good basis get a better understanding of
   the situation, covering different angles and aspects of network
   traffic and kind of networks.

2.1.1.  Overall traffic growth

   Based on the measuremenst data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan
   educational network, and a mobile operator it was observed at the
   beginning of the workshop that overall the network was able to handle
   the situation well despite an significant increase in traffic growth
   rate in March/April.

2.1.2.  Changes in traffic patterns

   Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased
   and traffic from home network increased.  Strong increase in video
   conferencing (incl remote schooling)

2.1.2.1.  Example campus network

   TBD...

2.1.2.2.  Example mobile networks

   TBD...

2.1.3.  A deeper look at interconnections

   Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly
   by adding new capacity (earlier?)

2.1.4.  Last mile congestion

   Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE)

2.1.5.  User Behaviour

   TBD...

2.2.  Operational Practices and Changes

   TBD...

2.3.  Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future

   TBD...

2.4.  Conclusions

   TBD...
